**Firstbox**

> Open command box
> 
> Type `/fb` and your wanted weapon `/fb s12 cel13 trident blunderbuss monkey`
> 
> Press enter and fast_restart

**Weapon Limit**

Some Weapons have a limit - which is not allowed to be changed. example: trident, limbo, blunderbuss... (Simply it means u cannot add something twice like /fb trident trident, as it means everyone now can have trident, thats a no no, only add weapons once)
