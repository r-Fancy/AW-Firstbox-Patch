**Normal Firstbox**

> Open command box
> 
> Type `/fb` and your wanted weapon `/fb s12 cel13 trident blunderbuss monkey`
> 
> Press enter and fast_restart

**Weapon Limit**

Some Weapons have a limit - which is not allowed to be changed. example: trident, limbo, blunderbuss... (Simply it means u cannot add something twice like /fb trident trident, as it means everyone now can have trident, thats a no no, only add weapons once)

**Strict Firstbox(solo.gsc)**

**Strict Weapon order**
> /fb s12 (1) nano(2) mahem(3) - You enter the command without the () this is just a example
> /fb s12 nano mahem - this is how u do it

**Coop**

Not avaible for strict firstbox due to several issues :/
